Title: PDF Question-Answering System using LangChain

1. Overview
This project builds a question-answering system over PDF documents using LangChain.
It extracts text from PDFs, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings, stores them
in a FAISS vector database, and answers user queries with an OpenAI LLM.

2. Tools
- Python 3.9+
- LangChain
- OpenAI API
- FAISS
- PyPDF

3. Workflow
- Load PDF -> Split text -> Create embeddings -> Store in FAISS
- At query time: retrieve relevant chunks -> send to GPT -> return answer.

4. Example
Input: "What is Newton's second law?"
Output: "Newtonâ€™s Second Law states that force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma)."

5. Future Work
- Add Streamlit web UI
- Use local embeddings to reduce API costs
